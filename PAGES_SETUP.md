# Make the live site show the app (not this README)

The themed Rules Hub is built by **GitHub Actions**. For it to appear at **https://gio300.github.io/SS-Tournaments/** you must:

1. **Set the Pages source to GitHub Actions**
   - Open: [Settings → Pages](https://github.com/Gio300/SS-Tournaments/settings/pages)
   - Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch").

2. **Run the workflow** (if it didn’t run on the last push)
   - Open: [Actions](https://github.com/Gio300/SS-Tournaments/actions)
   - Select **Deploy to GitHub Pages**, then **Run workflow** → **Run workflow**.

After the workflow finishes, the site will show the dark theme, Rules, FAQ, Rules Bot, and Community board.
